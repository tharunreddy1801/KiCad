# PCB Design

This project demonstrates the design of a printed circuit board (PCB) tailored for a specific application. The design showcases all the essential steps, from schematic creation to layout, component placement, routing, and final design files. This project serves as a guide for those looking to develop custom PCBs for their own unique applications.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To design a PCB for blinking LEDs using a 555 timer IC.
- **Tools Used:** KiCad
- **Design Goals:**  
  - Compact and efficient layout  
  - Optimal component placement for performance  
  - Reliable and manufacturable PCB design  

## Project Details

### Schematic Design
The schematic was created to map out the connections and components required for the application. Each component's value and pin connections were carefully chosen to meet the design specifications.

### PCB Layout
The PCB layout was created by importing the schematic, defining the board outline, and placing components in a logical and accessible manner. Special attention was given to:

- Signal integrity
- Power distribution
- Thermal management

### Design Verification
The PCB design was checked for errors and validated through design rule checks (DRC) to ensure manufacturability.

## Files Included

- **Schematics:** Diagrams showing the connections and components.
- **PCB Layout:** The final board layout with components and traces.
- **Gerber Files:** Manufacturing files ready for PCB production.

## Getting Started

To view or modify the design, open the project files in KiCad. Detailed instructions are provided in the documentation folder to guide you through the setup process.
